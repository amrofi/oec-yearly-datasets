## How to use this project

While you can run the scripts from UNIX terminal, we highly recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

Each project is organized as an RStudio project. Each project contains a master scripts titled `0-some-function.R` at the top level.

The master scripts, for any case, run a function with user prompt. The safe way to run this without errors is to open the project and then run the master script from RStudio.

[OEC Packages Snapshot](https://github.com/observatory-economic-complexity/oec-packages-snapshot) stores all packages and its dependencies used across all repositories under this organization. To ease reproducibility [OEC Bundles](https://github.com/observatory-economic-complexity/oec-bundles) contains several bundles to avoid dependencies or packages related problems.
